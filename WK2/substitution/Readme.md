# Substitution Cipher

# Description: 
This program encrypts a given plaintext message using a user-specified key. The key must contain 26 characters and only consist of alphabetical letters. The program will then substitute each letter of the plaintext message with a corresponding letter from the key, preserving the case of the original letter.

# Usage: 
To run the program, compile and execute it with the command ./substitution key, where key is a string of 26 alphabetical characters. The program will prompt the user to enter the plaintext message to be encrypted. The encrypted message, or ciphertext, will be printed to the terminal.

# Example:
## Input:
./substitution abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
plaintext: Hello, World!

## Output:
ciphertext: Hvww, Dqgri!
