This is a program that implements the Caesar cipher, a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in a message by a certain number of places. The program takes in a key as a command line argument, which is the number of places to shift the letters in the message. It then prompts the user to enter a plaintext message, and outputs the encrypted message (ciphertext).
